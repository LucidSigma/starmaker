# StarMaker
A MERN app that allows the user to create planets and stars.  
This is my first major MERN and TypeScript project.  
  
~~Hosted at: https://star-maker.herokuapp.com/~~ No longer hosted due to changes in Heroku.  

Since this is my first MERN/TypeScript project, I'm sure that I have missed some of the best practices.
